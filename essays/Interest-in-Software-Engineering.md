**Why Software Engineering**

When I played my first video game, I wanted to learn how to design them so that I could make my 
own kind of video games. As I grew up and learned more types of gaming, I want to try make one that 
has many types of gaming into one. Growing up however, I came to realize that such a process would be 
very complex as I later discovered programming languages existed. I believe learning software engineering 
is the first step to video game designing.

**What I hope do to later**

Since I like to draw, I hope I can do both design the game and create the characters and places for the 
gameplay. Ever since I was little, I liked the idea of combing different things that came from different 
places into one world or universe. I have created characters since elementary year and as years passed I have
always kept drawing them and see that I have improved over the years. However, I do think my drawings are not 
good enough at my current level but maybe later on as I keep practicing that they will look great to be used.

**What experiences I hope to develop**

I am hoping software engineering will help me learn aspects of what it takes to develop video games or 
applications for mobile devices. Aside from having to take the course by force now, I am hoping that 
the experiences I learn from this course will help me in the future to do what I want to do. That is to 
design model characters to be used for game development and create mechanics for the games and hopefully 
turn out to make a great game.

**Experience VS Expectation**

With the semester ending, I have no regrets in taking a software engineering class. What I learned in the class passed my expectations of the course. Though I have not used it for gaming design purposes yet, I have learned many tools that will help me do other things such as making web applications and built in functions for it. Thanks to this class, I was able to get my feet wet with a team project to make a <a href="http://moarchow.meteorapp.com/">web application</a> and get a taste as well for how it is like to work on a project with a team. Game designs will take a team to work on such a feat so I am glad I got to experience that.
