**Direct Hit!...Twice!!!**

These past two weeks of was such as struggle personally. The program Meteor is another type of Framework where it allows one to code and display
pages and have user type capabilities when interacting with it. When first introduced to it, I thought I was going to not like it due to it 
explaining a lot and in the first week it did feel like my head got hit with a meteor....maybe two. I'm sure there are some that do this, but I 
used a desktop and a laptop to do my work with meteor these past couple weeks and doing that was a fraction of the pain meteor caused me when I
started understanding it. 

Luckily before Meteor, I picked up on HTML and CSS style of coding for frameworks really quick and learned Semantic UI style easily as well. Meteor also 
involved using HTML and CSS coding languages which I felt like that was not a problem. The only really difficult thing is that when referencing code from 
other templates there were some misplaced lines that caused problems and took forever to figure out why and then feel stupid afterwards. For example, I had a 
moment where I placed a button in a different line and did not know why the button would not work when I went to test it.

However, the javascript part was messing up my head a lot. If it were for not having the examples given to use as reference, I do not think I would have ever thought
of using javascript like that to add functions for dealing with user interaction abilities like options to add, remove, update things like in the picture below.

Even after the two weeks, I still feel like I do not fully understand it but luckily I have the references to keep staring at in hopes of one day fully understanding.
Maybe its due to the fact I am still learning javascript since I was recently introduced to it so I guess its a matter of just keep using it differently.
