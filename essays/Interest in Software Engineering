When I played my first video game, I wanted to learn how to design them so that I could make my 
own kind of video games. As I grew up and learned more types of gaming, I want to try make one that 
has many types of gaming into one. Growing up however, I came to realize that such a process would be 
very complex as I later discovered programming languages exist.

Since I like to draw, I hope I can do both design the game and create the characters and places for the 
gameplay. Ever since I was little, I liked the idea of combing different things that came from different 
places into one world or universe. I do think my drawings are not good enough at my current level but maybe 
later on as I keep practicing that they will look great to be used.

I am hoping software engineering will help me learn aspects of what it takes to develop video games or 
applications for mobile devices. Aside from having to take the course by force now, I am hoping that 
the experiences I learn from this course will help me in the future to do what I want to do. That is to 
design model characters to be used for game development and create mechanics for the games and hopefully 
turn out to make a great game.
