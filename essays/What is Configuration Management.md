When I hear configuration management, I think about it is something that revolves around managing some kind of settings 
for a system or a program. I have never heard of configuration management for in terms of software engineering.  I do know
video games for example have some kind of system that holds a lot of coding that is managed by something so it can run smoothly
and can update it whenever the developers want to. Unfortunately, I have not had the experience to run into a problem from the
lack of knowing how to use configuration management for software engineering.  I would think GitHub is popular due to git since
apparently it allows one to make changes to your files while offline from the Internet which would be a great help for 
things such as updating a website perhaps while disconnected from the Internet.
