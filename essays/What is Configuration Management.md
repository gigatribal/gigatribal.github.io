**Prior to hearing Configuration Management**

When I heard configuration management, I think about it is something that revolves around managing some kind of settings 
for a system or a program. I have never heard of configuration management for in terms of software engineering.  I do know
video games for example have some kind of system that holds a lot of coding that is managed by something so it can run smoothly
and can update it whenever the developers want to. 


**Now I know. I Lucked Out?**

Fortunately, I have not had the experience to run into a problem from the lack of knowing how to use configuration management 
for software engineering. I have never worked on something so big that would be easier to do by using something like configuration management. Perhaps it is unfortunate since I do not know how helpful it is to have such methods available. However now that I do know about it, I will remember about them should I ever start working on something that having that would be helpful.

**Whom made the other better?**

I would think GitHub is popular due to git since apparently it allows one to make changes to your files while offline from the 
Internet which would be a great help for things such as updating a website perhaps while disconnected from the Internet. Being
able to do that in certain circumstances which could be working while there is a power outage that you cannot connect would be 
helpful. Another situation that would be useful to use this method is when you are taking a flight somewhere and instead of sleep
you could work on your local repositories.
