**It's....it's the law?**

Maybe saying its the law is a bit excessive, but it is a procedure that every coder should follow in order to code professionally. You
would not want to see a page of code that is not in correct format do you? Seeing extra spaces not needed, or curly braces on a new line, or
even using the wrong things to print out strings would maybe drive someone nuts. The coding standard is a normal thing now days and to not
follow it would be awful. If you do not want to see such terrible format of coding, then do not do it to others!

**ESlint & Intellij**

Like other editors, Intellij took time to get use to since prior to using it I have never heard of it. In other computer science course,
professors would go on about how this editor is great because reasons stated. Intellij is no different when it was told that we were going
to use it. With ESlint, the standards of coding is turned on and keeps track of what you may have done incorrectly which could be anything.
It is kind of a pain personally to have to manually turn on all settings I need to get my standards for coding up and running. Sometimes it
even looks like something gets turned off while I am in the middle of coding.

The green checkmarks do help because it is telling me I do meet the requirements of the coding standard. Looking at my codes when I go over
them, reading the lines seem easy because you can find things more easily. Such as finding a certain line in a if statement that is within a
for loop could easily be found because of all the indents which indicate you are inside a curly bracket of statement and you know a semicolon
means its the end of the line. Eventually you find it and you know for sure that the line is indeed in a if statement which is within a for loop.

**Standards for all languages seem similar?**

As I learn about new programming languages and eventually finding out the coding standards for that language, it seems that the standard is not
so much different from any other standards I come across. The one I am using now seems to be very similar (if not the same) to the standards
I used when using C/C++ versus javascript. That is not a bad thing since it means that reading codes should be easy if the standards are followed.
If so, everyone would have such an easier time to read lines of code, especially when the codes become super long.
