**How’s Javascript?**

Javascript is an entirely new programming language to me. Compared to Java and C/C++, it looks like it closely resembles C/C++ more which I used for a course in last fall. I am unsure if it’s a good programming language for software engineering due to I have no prior knowledge to what it is like. I do have concerns with some aspects of Javascript though. For example, I did a practice tutorial for Javascript and even though I completed it, there were things I heard after taking the tutorial which confuses me a little bit. Things include putting “var” before you name your variables is incorrect and should be using “let” instead. I have tried using both in the same use and do not see much difference at the moment.

**Athletic Software Engineering Reflection (WODs)**
 
 I have mixed feelings about WODs (Workouts of the Day). I do like the idea that being timed to do programming correctly in a pressurized situation makes good experience for jobs. I have done the practice WODs that were useful to the WOD that we do in class. When we were presented the WOD problem to do I already knew what was needed and how to put it together where as I probably wouldn’t have if I did not do the practice WODs. However, I do not like how WODs are heavily influenced on the students’ grade of the course. In the grading system, it stated it is a significant percentage of our grade. If one does not finish by the time limit set, they do not receive a grade for it is what was stated I believe and there is no partial points. I find it too stressful, especially if one is doing the WOD in class it is sitting in the back of their heads thinking “If I don’t finish in time, I don’t get points”. 

**Experience on WOD so far**

The first WOD we did for class I did not finish in time despite my practicing. I finished typing within minutes but could not figure out why it would not work correctly and by the time I realized it, it was too late. It was a very easy WOD and the mistake I did was so simple I felt really stupid afterwards. Personally, I find it too stressful and even though it was just the first one I do not find it enjoyable. Of course I would say it isn’t fun because I did not finish and probably will not get points. As a student who is learning who has to learn another language that was not taught from previous courses, it seems quite harsh to be graded so strictly and heavily.I am unsure if it will work for me due to the fact of the first experience of it was horrid because of my simple mistake. It does bug me a lot because it was the first one and it was simple to get the points easily. I am very sure the WODs in the future will be that much more difficult and I am leaning towards that it will not work out for me at the rate its going for me. I have no disagreements about doing WODs to train ourselves to code quicker and having to do so in a timed situation. I just wish it would not be so heavily and strictly graded.
