Pah Ke's Chinese Restaurant use to be co-owned with my dad and his brother. The website was already made but was recently passed down to me due to my uncle wanting to retire and so my parents bought their half of the share and decided to save time by using this website and improve it from there with my spare time. 

<hr>

Has details of how to contact us, where we are, and a list of our menu item and prices and other details. The website is slowly progressing due to other responsibilities as a student. Since my parents dont know how to do this kind of thing, they looked to me for help to have a wesbite available for the business.
