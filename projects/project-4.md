summary: A web application from Fall 2016 to help University of Hawaii students find food establishments on University of Hawaii at Manoa campus.
---

<p> Near the end of the second half of Fall 2016, a class I took for Computer Science where we were grouped in teams to work on a web application project. My team created the web app called MoarChow, which is a food application where a student in the University of Hawaii can view both foodtruck and various food establishments across the Manoa campus. They are able to view their business hours and menu prices of their items, give a rating on the vendors, and also view a map in our application to see where each vendor is for guidance. </p>

When I created the Logo for our web app, I tried to think of an aspect from being a college student myself. If I were a college student trying to conserve on money for food, I would probably buy cup ramen. The logo is suppose to represent that cup ramen isnt satisfying enough anymore and real food is needed to quell the rage of cravings.

Though it was technically everyones job, I looked through to make sure that our web application was accurate in terms of hours, prices, map location, etc. Aside from that and the logo, my contributions to the project were 
<li>suggest a rating system</li>
<li>gather database information needed for various vendor places that my group split up the locations</li>
<li>being able to log in and making sure only logged in users can view the web app outside of the landing page
<li>finding users to test our web app</li>

The feedback we got was quite constructive besides their comments on how great the app was.
