summary: A web application from Fall 2016 to help University of Hawaii students find food establishments on University of Hawaii at Manoa campus and view business hours as well as viewing their menu.
---

<p> Near the end of the second half of Fall 2016, a class I took for Computer Science where we were grouped in teams to work on a web application project. My team created the web app called MoarChow, which is a food application where a student in the University of Hawaii can view both foodtruck and various food establishments across the Manoa campus. They are able to view their business hours and menu prices of their items, give a rating on the vendors, and also view a map in our application to see where each vendor is for guidance. </p>
