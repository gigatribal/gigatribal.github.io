The idea of the app was inspired by the professor to give us ideas for a project topic. The app can be opened on computer or with mobile phones by using a web browser. The home page is a login or register screen where you type in a name and password and if you are a first time user, you would need to hit register to be able to login later on. Once logged in, you are able to hit the get my location button to determine your current location and you can also check in to time stamp when you last checked what your location was. 
The app also allows you to check nearby Hawaii Electeds based on the location you are at. You are able to get a list of Electeds based on the coordinates and address you are at. Once you hit get Electeds, you get a person for the Mayor, Congressman, Senator, and House Rep.
Unfortunately, this is currently unavailable to use for the site I used to have people use this app is down due to the fact the site was only up during my time with the class in Spring 2016.
