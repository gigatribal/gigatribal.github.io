A project assignment to use our knowledge of C to create a simple phonebook where a non programmer could easily follow the directions and use this.

You are able to add a person and add some given details about the person. With just the name, you can modify, print, or delete the person along with the info. There is also the option to print every name added or delete everything. Duplicate names are possible, and printing or deleting specific names that have more than 1 of them results in them all being printed or deleted.
